### Parallel Execution
- two programs execute in parallel if they execute axactly at the same time
- at time t, an instruction is being performed fot both p1 and p2 programs
- need replicated hardware

### Why use parallel execution
- tasks may complete more quickly
- some tasks must be performed sequentially

### Concurrent Execution
- concurrent execution is not the same as parallel execution
- concurrent : start and end times overlap
- parallel : execute at the exact same time
